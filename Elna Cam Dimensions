Single cam / disc - this cam has lobes only on its lower part. They serve to move the needle between left and right stich positions
1. disc_thickness = 7mm;

Double cam / disc - this cam has lobes on the upper half of its height in addition to the lower part. They serve to move the cloth forwards and  backwards
1. double_disc_thickness = 9mm;


Common to both single and  double cam / disc - many of these align with the cam holder mechanism in the sewing machine

1. thickest_cyl_rad = 17mm - radius of the thickest cam cylinder. This is the basic cylinder on whose circumference the lobes will sit on. 
2. lobe_thickness = 4.5mm - height / thickness of each lobe that sits on the circumference of the basic cam cylinder.
3. inner_hole_rad = 8.25mm - radius of the inner hole in the cam cylinder. This hole is cut to make the cam go on the cam holder shaft.
4. hole_bigger_rad = 9.5mm - radius of the lower part of the inner hole in the cam cylinder. It is slightly bigger.
5. bigger_hole_ht = 1.5mm - height of the lower part of the inner hole in the cam cylinder. It is slightly bigger.
6. cut_errors = 0.1;
7. hole_cone_ht = 1.5;
8. skirting = 0;


Transport hole - this aligns the cam to the pin in the cam holder mechanism. It is made as a cuboid.

9. gap_to_transporthole = 1; distance of the transport hole from the edge of the bigger inner hole
10. transporthole_width = 3;
11. transporthole_depth = 5.5;
12. transporthole_length  = 4;

Considerations when a cam rotates in the sewing machine
1. Each rotation of the cam / cam holder shaft makes 18 stiches
