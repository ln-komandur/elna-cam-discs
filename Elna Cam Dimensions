Single cams / discs have lobes only on the lower part. 
They serve to move the needle between left and right stich positions
1. disc_thickness = 7mm;

Double cams / discs have lobes on the upper half of their height in addition to the lower part. 
They are thicker than single cams by 2mm to accommodate lobes on the upper half. But their inner hole is the same height as single cams. 
There is an additional bigger hole (2mm depth) on the top side of these cams just like the one on their bottom side to let them "click in" and "click out" of the cam holder. (see pictures)
2. double_disc_thickness = 9mm;


Common to both single and  double cam / disc - many of these align with the cam holder mechanism in the sewing machine

3. thickest_cyl_rad = 17mm - radius of the thickest cam cylinder. This is the basic cylinder on whose circumference the lobes will sit on. 
4. lobe_thickness = 4.5mm - height / thickness of each lobe that sits on the circumference of the basic cam cylinder.
5. inner_hole_rad = 8.25mm - radius of the inner hole in the cam cylinder. This hole is cut to make the cam go on the cam holder shaft.
6. hole_bigger_rad = 9.5mm - radius of the lower part of the inner hole in the cam cylinder. It is slightly bigger.
7. bigger_hole_ht = 1.5mm - height of the lower part of the inner hole in the cam cylinder. It is slightly bigger.
8. cut_errors = 0.1mm - this decides the finess of the printed sides. It also depends on the settings on the 3D printer. 
9. hole_cone_ht = 1.5mm - the height of the cone that tapers the bigger inner hole to the smaller inner hole. 
10. skirting = 0;


Transport hole - this aligns the cam to the pin in the cam holder mechanism. It is 3D printed as a void cuboid.

11. gap_to_transporthole = 1; distance of the transport hole from the edge of the bigger inner hole
12. transporthole_width = 3mm;
13. transporthole_depth = 5.5mm;
14. transporthole_length  = 4mm;


Size of letters on the cam
15. Font type - ?
16. Font size - ?
17. Depth - ?


Considerations when a cam rotates in the sewing machine
1. Each rotation of the cam / cam holder shaft makes 18 stiches / needle punches
2. The lower lobes on the body of a cam (single / double) serve to move the needle between left and right stich positions
3. The upper lobes on the body of a double cam serve to move the cloth forwards and backwards

Printing considerations
1. Cams print right side up (letters are on the top)
2. After they are printed, the 5 cams can be snapped free from each other.
